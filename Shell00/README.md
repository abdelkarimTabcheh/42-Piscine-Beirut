# Shell00

## Introduction

The Shell00 project is designed to introduce you to the basics of shell scripting and command-line operations in Unix-like operating systems. This project will help you become familiar with fundamental shell commands, file manipulation, and simple scripting.

## Core Concepts

- **Basic Shell Commands**: Learn essential shell commands for navigating the file system, manipulating files, and managing processes.
- **File Permissions**: Understand how to set and modify file permissions.
- **Scripting Basics**: Gain proficiency in writing simple shell scripts to automate tasks.

## Projects

### EX00: `z`
Write a command that prints "Z" followed by a newline to the standard output.

### EX01: `testShell00`
Create a file named `testShell00` that contains the command to list files in the current directory.

### EX02: `c`
Write a command that prints "C" followed by a newline to the standard output.

### EX03: `midLS`
Create a script `midLS` that lists files and directories in the current directory with specific formatting:
