# C01

C01 builds upon the concepts introduced in **[C00](42-Piscine-Beirut/C00/)** and introduces pointers, expanding your understanding of C programming.

## Core Concepts

- **Pointers and Referencing:** Understanding how pointers work and how they reference memory addresses.
  
- **Storing Values:** Exploring different ways to store values and manipulate them.
  
- **Div and Mod:** Utilizing division and modulus operations to perform calculations.
  
- **Conditions (if, else, else if):** Implementing conditional statements for decision-making in programs.

## Advanced Concepts

- **Strings and Arrays:** Working with strings and arrays in C programming.
  
- **Null Terminator:** Understanding the importance of null terminators in C strings.
  
- **Temporary Variables:** Using temporary variables to facilitate operations and swaps.

## Exercises

- **EX00** - Make a Pointer to 42
- **EX01** - Make a Pointer to a Pointer to a...to 42
- **EX02** - Swap Two Values, Using a Temporary Variable
- **EX03** - Use Div and Mod to Return a Value
- **EX04** - Store Values, Swap Them, use Div and Mod
- **EX05** - Write a String
- **EX06** - Get the Length of a String
- **EX07** - Implement a Function to Compare Two Strings
- **EX08** - Implement a Function to Concatenate Two Strings

Each exercise is designed to reinforce your understanding of pointers, strings, arrays, and conditional statements in C programming.
