# C08

## Introduction

The C08 project continues to build on your C programming skills by introducing new concepts such as handling header files, defining macros, and working with structures. This project will help you understand how to modularize your code, use preprocessor directives, and manipulate data structures effectively.

## Core Concepts

- **Header Files**: Learn how to create and include custom header files in your projects.
- **Macros**: Understand the use of macros for constant definitions and simple functions.
- **Structures**: Gain proficiency in defining and using structures to manage related data.

## Advanced Concepts

- **Modular Programming**: Develop the ability to split your code into multiple files and manage dependencies.
- **Preprocessor Directives**: Explore the use of preprocessor directives for conditional compilation and code inclusion.
- **Complex Data Handling**: Manipulate and manage more complex data types and structures.

## Projects

### EX00: `ft.h`
Create a header file `ft.h` that includes function prototypes for the following functions:
- `ft_putchar`: Function to print a character.
- `ft_swap`: Function to swap the values of two integers.
- `ft_putstr`: Function to print a string.
- `ft_strlen`: Function to return the length of a string.
- `ft_strcmp`: Function to compare two strings.

### EX01: `ft_boolean.h`
Define a header file `ft_boolean.h` that includes a boolean type definition and the following macros:
- `TRUE`
- `FALSE`
- `SUCCESS`
- `EVEN`
- `ODD`
- `EVEN_MSG`
- `ODD_MSG`

### EX02: `ft_abs.h`
Create a header file `ft_abs.h` that defines a macro `ABS` which computes the absolute value of a number.

### EX03: `ft_point.h`
Define a header file `ft_point.h` that includes a structure `t_point` to represent a point with `x` and `y` coordinates, along with a function prototype to initialize this structure.

### EX04: `ft_strs_to_tab`
Implement a function `ft_strs_to_tab` that takes an array of strings and returns an array of structures. Each structure should contain the string, its length, and a copy of the string.

### EX05: `ft_show_tab`
Create a function `ft_show_tab` that takes an array of structures (as defined in EX04) and displays their content.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Enhance your ability to modularize code using header files.
- Gain experience with macros and preprocessor directives.
- Improve your skills in defining and using data structures in C.
- Learn to manage dynamic data and complex data types effectively.
