# C11

## Introduction

The C11 project introduces functional programming concepts, higher-order functions, and advanced sorting techniques in C. This project will enhance your ability to work with function pointers, implement common functional programming patterns, and manage complex data operations.

## Core Concepts

- **Function Pointers**: Learn how to use and pass function pointers to achieve higher-order functions.
- **Functional Programming**: Understand the implementation of functional programming patterns in C.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Gain proficiency in implementing and customizing sorting algorithms.

## Advanced Concepts

- **Array Manipulation**: Develop the ability to manipulate arrays using functional programming techniques.
- **Conditional Operations**: Explore the use of higher-order functions for conditional operations on arrays.
- **Custom Sorting**: Implement custom sorting algorithms and criteria.

## Projects

### EX00: `ft_foreach`
Implement the function `ft_foreach` that applies a given function to each element of an integer array. The function should:
- Take an array of integers, its size, and a function pointer as parameters.
- Apply the given function to each element of the array.

### EX01: `ft_map`
Create the function `ft_map` that applies a given function to each element of an integer array and returns a new array with the results. The function should:
- Take an array of integers, its size, and a function pointer as parameters.
- Allocate memory for the new array and apply the given function to each element.

### EX02: `ft_any`
Write the function `ft_any` that checks if any element of a string array satisfies a given condition. The function should:
- Take an array of strings, a function pointer that checks a condition, and return `1` if any element satisfies the condition, otherwise `0`.

### EX03: `ft_count_if`
Develop the function `ft_count_if` that counts the number of elements in a string array that satisfy a given condition. The function should:
- Take an array of strings, a function pointer that checks a condition, and return the count of elements that satisfy the condition.

### EX04: `ft_is_sort`
Implement the function `ft_is_sort` that checks if an array of integers is sorted in ascending order. The function should:
- Take an array of integers, its size, and a function pointer that compares two integers.
- Return `1` if the array is sorted, otherwise `0`.

### EX05: `do_op`
Create the program `do_op` that performs simple arithmetic operations. The program should:
- Take three arguments: two integers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %).
- Perform the operation specified by the operator on the two integers and display the result.

### EX06: `ft_sort_string_tab`
Write the function `ft_sort_string_tab` that sorts an array of strings in ascending order. The function should:
- Take an array of strings and sort it using a suitable sorting algorithm.

### EX07: `ft_advanced_sort_string_tab`
Implement the function `ft_advanced_sort_string_tab` that sorts an array of strings according to a custom comparison function. The function should:
- Take an array of strings and a function pointer that compares two strings.
- Sort the array using the custom comparison function.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Enhance your ability to use and manipulate function pointers.
- Gain experience with implementing functional programming patterns in C.
- Improve your skills in array manipulation and advanced sorting techniques.
- Learn to implement custom sorting criteria and manage complex data operations.
