# Shell01 42 Piscine Project

## Introduction

The Shell01 project builds on the foundational skills learned in Shell00 by introducing more advanced shell scripting techniques and command-line operations. This project will help you deepen your understanding of shell scripting, text processing, and file manipulation.

## Core Concepts

- **Advanced Shell Commands**: Learn more complex shell commands and their options.
- **Scripting with Variables**: Understand how to use and manipulate variables in shell scripts.
- **Text Processing**: Gain proficiency in processing and manipulating text using shell commands.

## Projects

### EX00: `hello_shell`
Write a script `hello_shell` that prints "Hello Shell!" followed by a newline to the standard output.

### EX01: `echo`
Create a script `echo` that prints the arguments passed to it, separated by spaces.

### EX02: `current_dir`
Write a script `current_dir` that prints the absolute path of the current directory.

### EX03: `list_files`
Create a script `list_files` that lists all files and directories in the current directory and its subdirectories, sorted by name.
